# unManageable
### Created by isZachariah

I  first made this application for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I wanted an easier way for people to access these readings and decided to recreate the application for the web. I've  chosen to use the T3 stack, React, NextJS, Tailwindcss, TRPC, Prisma, and an sqlite database.
